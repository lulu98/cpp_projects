# Project: Tic Tac Toe

## Description

TicTacToe is a very simple game. You have two players that try to complete the
3x3 game. If one of the players gets three in a row, then he has won. In case
the board is full and no player has won yet, it's a draw.

## Build Instructions

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build ..
```

## Run Instructions

```bash
./tictactoe
```

## TODO

- maybe not have a separate board per player
- have better text alignment
