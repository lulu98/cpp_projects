# C++ Projects

This repository contains relevant projects on my journey to learn C++. I am
trying to include topics from [learncpp.com](https://www.learncpp.com/) and use
mostly the C++17 standard.

## Projects

- [Hangman](hangman/): class, abstract class, interface, inheritance, polymorphism,
aggregation, `State` design pattern, references, `std::array`, `std::vector`,
friend function, operator overloading
- [TicTacToe](tictactoe/): class, struct, enum, ternary operator

## TODO

- lambda
- for each loop
- exceptions
- move semantics
- templates
